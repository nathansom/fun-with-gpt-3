# fun-with-gpt-3

By Nathan Somsa-ard

A simple web app built with ReactJS/NextJS that lets users play with the GPT-3 AI model from Open AI through a simple, friendly user interface.

The GPT-3 AI model allows users to enter a prompt that commands the AI to write something from a poem to a practical joke. 

The app also uses Local Storage API to store the collection of prompts and responses. To retrieve past records, simply type anything into the prompt entry box or select any of the sample prompts.
